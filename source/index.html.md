# Introduction

Danbulant API is a wrapper around all of APIs available at danbulant.eu.
Most of endpoints currently don't require developer key, but for future use, we suggest still getting one. You won't do anything bad if you try to reach a free endpoint with developer key. You can contact us [here](https://discord.gg/dZtq4Qu) on our discord server to get information about getting one.
